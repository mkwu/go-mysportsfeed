This is a Go library that makes it easy to use the [MySportsFeeds API](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) if you are wanting to wirte Go code that needs access to sports stats provided by MySportsFeed.  

DISCLAIMER: I am not associated with MySportsFeed in anyway. 

The only endpoint that is working right now is the NBA cumulative player stats. I plan to add additional api calls as time permits.
